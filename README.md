Salary Calculator 🧮

Welcome to the repository for the Salary Calculator - v 1.00, a personal project created by Leonardo Paniagua Muñoz. This tool is designed to simplify the process of calculating salaries in Costa Rica, making it easier for both employers and employees to manage and compute their earnings effectively.

Features 🌟

Net Salary Calculation: Calculates the net salary after deductions from the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (CCSS) at a rate of 10.67%. 📉
Overtime Pay: Computes additional pay for overtime hours worked, at a rate of 1.5 times the regular hourly rate. ⏰
Holiday Pay: Calculates the pay for hours worked on holidays at double the regular hourly rate. 🎉

How It Works 🛠️

The calculator provides a user-friendly interface for inputting data:

Biweekly Payment Query: Specify if the salary is paid biweekly by entering 'S' (Yes) or 'N' (No).
Gross Salary Input: Input your gross salary.
Overtime Hours: Enter the number of regular overtime hours worked.
Holiday Hours: Specify hours worked during holidays if applicable.
After inputting the necessary data, the calculator processes it and provides a detailed breakdown of the gross salary, deductions, and net pay, including specific calculations for overtime and holiday pay.

Usage 🔍

To run the calculator, download the repository and execute the script in your preferred Python environment. The calculator is interactive and prompts you for data step-by-step.
